    <h1>Daniel Javier's Things I Like are playing games, watching tv & creating stuff</h1>
    <p>I'm taking this class, because I'm interested of having a website of me like anyone else. I'm also interested on creating some details and instructions on how to do so. I'm also doing this to learn how to code computers and stuff</p>
    <h2>Photographing pictures around the area or in town</h2>
    <p> This hobby I did was photographing all because I learned how to take better pictures with my camera in my photography class with Justin last semester. It also helps me on details of the picture such as ISO and POV. I also get to learn on how do I import those on the computer and edit them with adobe
       
    </p>
    <h2>Airport</h2>

    <p>This hobby I did was the process of going through airports. I did this because it reminds me of first flight I took to mexico back in 2023. The things I interested of seeing are where does my suitcase go when I check in and how does security work. </p>
    <h3>Traffic lights</h3>
    <p>Another hobby I liked was involving the details of traffic lights. Ever since I was young I noticed 2 differences of traffic lights here in illinois. Normally there would be 2 lights on the structure with one having left turn. On some cases, there would be 3 lights, with 1 only having left turn. One thing i'm interested is the traffic lights hanging on the wiring that normally happens during construction. </p>
    <h3>Computer</h3>
    <p>One of the good hobbies I had was using the PC. Some things I like to do are creating stuff on google sites such as google docs, sheets & Slides. I also liked creating real things on program called roblox studio. </p>

    <h2>Traffic</h2>
    <p>One thing I liked about traffic is the highway designs. Some highways have 2 lanes while I like the 3 lane better. One of the most interesting highways are interstate roads since they have longer route with no traffic lights and can lead to other states.</p>
    <p>I attend school at <a href="http://www.mchenry.edu">McHenry County College</a></p>
